    "text": "Executive Summary\nThe objective of this work is to provide regulators, legislators, and other energy stakeholders with a holistic look at recent trends in electrical generation. The first impetus for this report is a lack of combined reporting on electricity generation across the state that extends to federally and non-federally regulated electric utilities (most of Alaska’s electric utilities do not meet the minimum threshold for federal reporting requirements). The second impetus for this report is to aid in decision-making processes surrounding Alaska’s energy future.\nWith uncertainty in natural gas sources on the Railbelt, technological advancements in generation technology, and improvements in the affordability of technologies, understanding trends in the state’s capacity, generation, consumption, and prices is vital to more informed decision-making.\nIn this report, we present data collected from federal, state, and local sources supplemented by correspondence with utilities. We show trends for capacity, generation, consumption, and prices. The capacity and generation trends include data from 2011 to 2021, and the consumption and prices trends are data limited to 2019. More information on sources and methods are provided in the subsequent sections throughout the report. This report uses data visualizations as the primary mode for presenting the trends. To accommodate this presentation style, we present trends as simplified regions of the state as opposed to the Alaska Energy Authority energy regions.\nWe emphasize that this report is designed to provide factual information to the best of our ability without providing recommendations or in-depth analysis. However, context is provided for more impactful trends.",

    "text": "2.3 Power Cost Equalization (PCE)\nAlaska is famous for wide expanses of rugged terrain. Towns are often extremely distant from one another, or are separated by inaccessible mountains and glaciers. The utility landscape of Alaska resembles a sea of islands, very different from the interconnected grids of the contiguous United States.\nIn total, Alaska contains over 100 separate utilities, many of which serve a single, small community. Most rely on diesel generators connected to huge fuel tanks, which receive a barge shipment of fuel in the summer that must last through the winter. If the town runs out of fuel during winter months, additional fuel has to be flown in at extreme expense. Predictably, electricity in these remote towns is extremely expensive.\nSome rural towns pay 3 to 5 times the rates of urban Alaska. Urban Alaska has greatly benefited from large state-subsidized energy projects, such as the Bradley Lake Hydroelectric Project, the Four Dam Pool Projects, and the Alaska Intertie. In an effort to confer similar benefits to rural Alaska, the state of Alaska developed the Power Cost Equalization Program (PCE).\nThe PCE program reimburses rural utilities for credits that have been provided to eligible customers. Eligibility is limited to residential customers and community facilities. The subsidy applies to the first 750 kWh per month of residential consumption. Community facilities are subsidized up to the first 70 kWh per month per resident. The program is administered by the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA) and the Alaska Energy Authority (AEA).\nPlease visit the Alaska Energy Authority PCE webpage for more information about the Power Cost Equalization program.",

    "text": "3.1 General Overview\nGeneration capacity represents the maximum amount of electricity that can be generated at any given time dependent on certain conditions. The combination of generation sources is often referred to as the capacity mix. Changes in the capacity mix over time reflect decisions to build and retire generators. These decisions are a result of shifting costs, technological innovations, the normal aging of the generation fleet, and/or stakeholder policies. Due to data limitations, we show capacity levels for calendar years 2011-2013, 2018, and 2021. While we cannot observe year-to-year trends, there are enough years of data to visualize capacity trends from 2011 to 2021.\nWe begin this section by showcasing the increases in total capacity across the state. In 2011, it is estimated that the total statewide electricity generation capacity was 2,197 MW. We estimate that this has increased to approximately 3,163 MW in 2021 based on best available data. This represents an increase of 966 MW, or 44 percent increase since 2011. To illustrate this example, we show a stacked area chart in Figure 3.1 that showcases growth over time for various technologies.1\nFigure 3.1: Capacity Changes, Statewide",

    "text": "4.1 General Overview\nThis section outlines the trends in generation by fuel type for each region. Generation in our context has two separate definitions. Data collected through the Energy Information Administration (EIA) records “net” generation, which excludes electricity use for power plant operations.1 However, data collected from the Alaska Energy Authority’s (AEA) Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program is presented as “gross” generation, which does not make this exclusion.2\nFigure 4.1 provides a visual representation of yearly electricity generation for the Coastal, Railbelt, and Rural Remote regions. All regions produced a relatively consistent amount of electricity between 2011 and 2021. Across this time period, the Railbelt generated an average of 5,109 GWh, the Coastal region generated an average of 1,131 GWh, and the Rural Remote region generated an average of 529 GWh. Between 2011 and 2021, the average yearly growth rate for generation was 1.62% in the Coastal region, -0.82% in the Railbelt region, and 0.99% in Rural Remote communities.3 The Coastal and Rural Remote trends are in line with improvements in rural electrification, as well as modest population growth. Of the regions, the Railbelt is the only one that consistently saw decreases in generation across the years. Total statewide generation increased at an average annual growth rate of -0.28%.\nFigure 4.1: Electricity Generation by Region\nWhile generation did not change significantly during the observed time period, the resources from which generation occurred, did. Figure 4.2 shows how the mix of generation fuels changed between 2011 and 2021.4\nFigure 4.2: Regional Changes in Net Generation\nWe show that for these resources, the Coastal region displaced oil generation with hydro and wind generation. The Railbelt displaced gas and oil generation with coal, hydro, and solar generation. Finally, the Rural Remote region of the state displaced coal and a small amount of hydro with gas, solar, and wind generation.\nThis figure does not include trends in storage or the other category. Storage net generation is always negative due to the efficiency of current battery systems where more energy is sent to storage than can be recovered. The “other” category was not included in this figure as net generation was zero in 2011 and 2021 (but not throughout the series, which we show in the subsequent sections).",

More recent data has been omitted due to issues with data completeness and validity.\nAcross the state, electricity sales (herein referred to as consumption), has fallen when comparing the 2011 and 2019 calendar years. To visualize this trend, we look at the percentage changes from 2011 to 2019 in electricity consumption by customer class (Figure 5.1). We highlight the following customer class definitions:\nStatewide electricity consumption growth for the residential sector was -10.86% from 2,141 GWh in 2011 to 1,909 GWh in 2019. The commercial sector growth was -6.34% from 2,758 GWh in 2011 to 2,583 GWh in 2019. Finally, Statewide electricity consumption growth for the ‘Other’ customer class was -7.46% from 1,378 GWh in 2011 to 1,275 GWh in 2019.\nFigure 5.1: Change in Sales by Customer Class, Statewide, from 2011 to 2019\nWe also examine the change in the number of customer accounts across the state. The total number of customer accounts in the state increased 6.15% from approximately 326,402 to 346,476. We plot the percentage increases in customer accounts by category in Figure 5.2. Residential accounts across the state increased 5.22% from approximately 275,473 to 289,843. The number of commercial accounts across the state increased 11.77% from 46,411 to 51,875. Finally, the number of other accounts across the state has increased 14.87% from approximately 4,518 to 5,190.\nFigure 5.2: Change in Customer Accounts by Class, Statewide, from 2011 to 2019\nFigure 5.3  shows the average annual electricity consumption for each of the regions. The Coastal region led the state in consumption per capita, with an average of 8,980 kWh per customer per year. This was followed by the Railbelt region with 7,118 kWh per capita and the Rural Remote region with 4,868 kWh per capita. Overall, each region has seen reductions in consumption per capita, which may reflect improvements in energy efficient technologies and energy efficiency/conservation behaviors.\nFigure 5.3: Average Residential Sales per Customer",

    "text": "6.1 General Overview\nUtilities in Alaska serve multiple customers, namely residential, commercial, industrial, government/municipal, and community customer classes. Each customer class experiences a different set of costs such as per kWh charge as well as monthly customer charges. In this section, we aim to highlight trends in electricity prices for the residential, commercial, and other customer classes across the Coastal, Railbelt, and Rural Remote regions. We again restrict the data years in this section to 2011 to 2019 due to concerns with data validity for 2020-21.\nIn rural areas, many communities are eligible to participate in the PCE program (described in Section 2.3). It is important to note that the prices presented here reflect the post-PCE adjustment and are annualized averages based on the calendar year. Yearly average effective rates listed here reflect the calendar year and not the fiscal year, which will make them different from those reported in the AEA’s annual reports. We also note that for PCE communities, the rates are reported in the original data. For data sourced from the EIA, rates were calculated by dividing total revenue by total kWh sold in each customer class - this may overestimate the rate as this would include revenue from customer charges.\nNote that all prices in this section have been adjusted for inflation over time to 2021 dollars using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items in urban Alaska (BLS CUUSA427SA0). To our knowledge, there is no CPI that properly accounts for price changes over time in rural Alaska.

Between 2011 and 2019, the region experienced decreasing prices for Commercial and Other customers, while Residential customers have seen a slight increase in price.\nThe average real price (in 2021 dollars) of electricity for Residential customers in the Coastal region rose 2% from 17.18 cents/kWh in 2011 to 17.59 cents/kWh in 2019. The average price of electricity for Commercial customers in the Coastal region fell -6% from 20.86 cents/kWh in 2011 to 19.67 cents/kWh in 2019. Finally, the average price of electricity for Other customers in the Coastal region fell -16% from 40.22 cents/kWh in 2011 to 33.85 cents/kWh in 2019.\nResidential customers in the Coastal region saw increases in the price of electricity while commercial and other customers saw decreases. However, the residential customer class continues to pay the lowest per kWh in the region due to a combination of low prices in high population areas and PCE subsidies in eligible communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Sector Price Over Time, Coastal Region",

    "text": "A.2 Historical Timeline of Prior Reports\n\n\n\nFigure A.1: Timeline of Energy Reports\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting in 1969, the first Electric Power Trends report was published by the Alaska Power Administration. During this time, the Alaska Power Administration was a federal agency housed within the U.S. Department of the Interior. Their first publication was known as the “First Annual Report” and covered data from the 1968 fiscal year. However, this became the “Alaska Electric Power Statistics Report” in 1971 and examined data from the 1960-1969 data years. The APA continued to produce intermittent reports until 1983 when the State of Alaska established the Alaska Power Authority (APA), which later became the Alaska Energy Authority (AEA).\nUnder state direction, the APA/AEA continued to publish intermittent reports on electric power statistics until their final publication in 1992 which covered data years 1960 to 1991. To address the reporting gap, the Alaska Systems Coordinating Council in collaboration with the State of Alaska, Department of Community and Regional Affairs, Division of Energy continued generating reports until 1996 with their final report covering data years 1960 to 1995. Finally, the University of Alaska Anchorage, Institute of Social and Economic Research produced several reports with their last covering 1960 to 2012. Since then, there have been no electric power statistical reports.\nThe Table A.1 provides a summary of this timeline. This report serves to supplement the reporting gap in electric power statistics for the State of Alaska.\n\n\n\nTable A.1: Historical Timeline of Reports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear Published\nInstitution\nData Coverage\n\n\n\n\n1971 to 1983\nAlaska Power Administration\n1960 to 1982\n\n\n1984 to 1988\nAlaska Power Authority\n1960 to 1987\n\n\n1989 to 1992\nAlaska Energy Authority\n1960 to 1991\n\n\n1992 to 1996\nAlaska Systems Coordinating Council; State of Alaska\n1960 to 1995\n\n\n2003, 2011 to 2015\nUniversity of Alaska Anchorage, Institute of Social and Economic Research\n1960 to 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a table of links to these historic reports, please refer to Table B.1.",
